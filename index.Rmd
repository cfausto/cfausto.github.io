## Bio
<br>
Welcome to my page! I am an incoming PhD Student at the Keck School of Medicine studying Development, Stem Cells, and Regenerative Medicine. I am highly interested in understanding the genetic regulatory networks and molecular signal pathways that drive developmental patterns, and hope to use these pathways to treat chronic disease and congenital abnormalities.

## Research Focus
<br>
I currently study human kidney development in the [Lindström Lab](https://lindstromlab.usc.edu/), with an emphasis on the nephron (filtration unit of the kidney). I am specifically interested in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway's link to the nascent nephron's cell identities and morphogenetic features. I hope to leverage *in vitro* hiPSC kidney organoids, and multi-omic sequencing, and high-resolution imaging to create developmental blueprints for kidney organogenesis.

I am highly motivated to build off our past atlases of [human](https://sckidney.flatironinstitute.org/) and [mouse](https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/) nephrogenesis to create regenerative cell types for therapeutic discovery and renal replacement therapy.
