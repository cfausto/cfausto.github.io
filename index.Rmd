## Bio

Welcome to my page! I am an incoming PhD Student at the Keck School of Medicine study Development, Stem Cells, and Regenerative Medicine. I am highly interested in understanding the genetic regulatory networks and molecular signal pathways that drive developmental patterns, and hope to use these pathways to treat chronic disease and congenital abnormalities. 

## Research Focus

I currently study human kidney development in the [Lindström Lab](https://lindstromlab.usc.edu/), with an emphasis on the nephron (filtration unit of the kidney). We are highly motivated to build an atlas of [human](https://sckidney.flatironinstitute.org/) and [mouse](https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/) nephrogenesis to create regenerative cell types for therapeutic discovery and renal replacement therapy.

My main project studies the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and its link to the nascent nephron's cell identities and morphogenetic features, and how misprogrammed signals lead to congenital abnormalities of the kidney.
